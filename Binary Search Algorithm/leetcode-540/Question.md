# Qustion - Leetcode-540: Single Element in a Sorted Array

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly **once**.

_**Return the single element that appears only once.**_

Your solution must run in `O(log n)` time and `O(1)` space.



### Example 1:

> **_Input_**: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]  
**_Output_**: 2
### Example 2:

> **_Input_**: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]  
**_Output_**: 10


### Constraints:

> - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`  
> - `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`
